## Introduction

*jsonfeeds* is an ihandler for [dionaea].

The purpose of *jsonfeeds* is to log events provided by dionaea in a JSON format via HTTP-POST to an HTTPS server. This module is developed for the [TraCINg] project but could be used to post to a custom server.


## Requirements

### dionaea

Of course *jsonfeeds* requires dionaea.

You can use the [complete compiling instructions], below the compiling instructions is also a section for packages on common distributions. If you want to use dionaea on Arch Linux ARM you can find the packages on https://github.com/Cyber-Incident-Monitor/PKGBUILDs.


### python

Like all dionaea ihandlers *jsonfeeds* is written in python3 (which is already required by dionaea).

Additionally, *jsonfeeds* depends on [python-requests], please read their installation guide or search for a package from your distribution.


## Configuration

Like other ihandlers for dionaea *jsonfeeds* reads its configuration from the dionaea configfile, wich can be found in most installations in /opt/dionaea/etc/dionaea/dionaea.conf

A sample configuration is provided in dionaea.conf.diff (as a diff to the default dionaea.conf).

## Installation

### manual

  - copy jsonfeeds.py to /opt/dionaea/lib/dionaea/python/dionaea
  - patch config into dionaea.conf
  - patch ihandler into /opt/dionaea/lib/dionaea/python/dionaea/ihandlers.py 
  - if you are using client certificates copy the certificate and key into the location you provided in the config

### automatic

The automatic scripts should work if you are using a default installation of dionaea:

  - check (and edit) the paths provided in config.sh
  - check (and edit) the config in dionaea.conf.diff
  - run install.sh
